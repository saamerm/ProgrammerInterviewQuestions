# Programmer Interview Technical Questions

### Inspiration

Since Amazon is known to have the most difficult interview process, and they expect you to be really good at questions that revolve around a lot of concepts that are not used in day to day programming. So this is a list of just my successful attempts at solving problems I found on different websites. Also, at a job interview, stellar coding skills differentiates you from the masses.

### How to Use this Repo

* You have to use a software (eg: Visual Studio) that allows you to Execute C# Console Applications
* The entry point to the application is the Program.cs file
* Classes are organized based on difficulty and origin of the question
* Helper classes are created for encouraging code reuse
* Some commented code is my unsuccessful attempt at increasing the time efficiency of my solution

### Sources of Questions

* One the sources is the list found on the simple programmer website, https://simpleprogrammer.com/programming-interview-questions/. I also placed a copy in the Instructions.txt file for offline use
* Another is just Leetcode's list of questions by difficult
